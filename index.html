          <p class="text--top">Sometimes, a piece of design has been around forever, and the longevity of it makes it exist in a way where it is unquestioned. It's accepted as a default and nobody really thinks about what that default means.</p>

        <h2>Examining &amp; Questioning</h2>
        <p class="text--center">So much of design lies in just poking things that already exist. Why is this like it is? Does it have to be? What would change if it was different? How different does it even need to be? Sometimes the most interesting design problems are very very small nudges or course corrections, not big sweeping features.</p>

          <p class="text--bottom padding-right">Most design is just sitting and wrestling with the problem. You research and ponder, stare off into space, occassionally draw a rectangle, and then stare off again. When you are about to dedicate a portion of your life to something, clarifying the purpose and intent behind the concept should take as long as it should. What good will it do, and what bad can it do?</p>
