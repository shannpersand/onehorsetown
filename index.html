        <article class="project-description">
          <h3 class="standfirst">
            At Braintree, I was tasked with leading the ground up redesign of a legacy product called Drop-In UI: a widely used product that gave merchants ready-to-use PCI compliant credit card forms that blended into their own checkouts. I headed this 2 year project at Braintree handling a wide range of design tasks and collaborations in addition to overseeing the product schedule and release.

        <p class="article-text">The original Drop-in was an isolated iframe that merchants could include on their website as a snippet of code, with a bit of integration. It was a product meant to have a low bar for entry which would allow merchants to accept payments easily while not having to go through a lengthy compliance process, and included both a web and mobile version.</p>

      <article class="bravo"><img src="images/dropin/dropin1.png" /></article>
      <article class="bravo">
        <p class="article-text">This was great for merchants, but for Drop-in users, the interface for Drop-in was fairly confusing. There were no clear input borders and the design was pretty opinionated, it didn't always mesh with Merchant's websites. Some Merchants were even sending out annotated screenshots to their customers explaining how to pay.</p>

      <article class="bravo"><img src="images/dropin/dropin2.png" /></article>
      <article class="bravo">
        <p class="article-text">I spent much of the first part of the project working on product and feature placement within the Braintree/PayPal ecosystem. There was a lot of research done on how the product could coexist with others and whether it should just be killed.</p>
        <p class="article-text">During this time we were able to establish that the product was actually doing quite a bit of volume and did have brand name recognition, both factors that pushed for a redesign rather than a sunsetting.</p>

      <article class="bravo"><img src="images/dropin/dropin3.png" /></article>
      <article class="bravo">
        <p class="article-text">Due to timelines and engineer availability, we chose to refresh the mobile version of Drop-in first. The issues with the mobile version were fairly straightforward, we needed mainly to clean a few usability issues up and also accommodate more payment method options.</p>
      </article>
      <article class="bravo"><img src="images/dropin/dropin4.png" /></article>
      <article class="bravo">
        <p class="article-text">After lots of testing of different layouts and styling, we settled relatively quickly on something that fit with existing iOS and Android system styles. We then spent time to refresh the credit card form and built a custom keyboard for expiration date input.</p>
        <p class="article-text">We ran the mobile version through more usability testing and prepared the mobile version for release.</p>
      </article>
      <article class="bravo"><img src="images/dropin/dropin5.png" /></article>
      <article class="bravo">
        <p class="article-text">While the mobile redesign clipped along at a fairly quick pace and was pretty straightforward in terms of design decisions, when it came to tackling the web version, the story was quite different.</p>
        <p class="article-text">I spent the initial sketch phase working on the issues of usability with the first version, and also on the scaling problem that had by this time become more urgent. ApplePay, VisaCheckout, and  GooglePay had all recently launched and merchants wanted to easily accept whatever methods were available.</p>
      </article>
      <article class="bravo"><img src="images/dropin/dropin6.png" /></article>
      <article class="bravo">
        <p class="article-text">We settled on a fancy customized dropdown as the main design direction. This was in order to minimize the space on the Merchant's checkout and be less of an obtrusive element on the page. There were two main directions we tested, one that was a two step process and another that could be a one step process.</p>
        <p class="article-text">The two step process had the advantage of funneling the user down a path and removing distraction, and the single step process had the advantage of speed.</p>
      </article>
      <article class="bravo"><img src="images/dropin/dropin7.png" /></article>
      <article class="bravo">
        <p class="article-text">Between user testing and speaking with the consumer group at PayPal, we found that though usability wise there were no issues with the dropdown, there were other considerations that would affect the design. There was a cognitive cost for a user to open a dropdown, not knowing what is under it and needing to parse out that information.</p>
        <p class="article-text">So, we stepped back and did a little loop into some earlier sketches that were based more on a radio/accordion selection process. We re-used the idea of funneling the user down a path for clarity from the dropdown approach, but refined it so that Drop-in now behaved more like an isolated widget all to itself.</p>
      </article>
      <article class="bravo"><img src="images/dropin/dropin8.png" /></article>
      <article class="bravo">
        <p class="article-text">Then, we tested the shit out of that version. We built a little fake store with all the directions in them and ran users through different flows getting them to complete checkouts in various ways to make sure there were no issues.</p>

        <p class="article-text">We got Merchants processing millions of dollars to upgrade, and most of our top selling Drop-in Merchants updated to the 2.0 version. Since release, even more payment methods have been added, and Drop-in handles that scaling beautifully.</p>

        <p class="article-text">In that meeting, I learned there were these companies called BPOs (Business Process Outsourcing) that clients were using. Essentially, Stripe had a lot of BPOs (also referred to as vendors) who were providing some of their customer service. Often a client would need BPO coverage for customer service for a variety of reasons, perhaps covering different languages, timezones, or outsourcing the less technical support questions.</p>

        <p class="article-text">After pitching the idea to Stripe of collaborating on a new product for managing BPOs, we realized we needed to back up and really get a team and data sorted. We set out for Ireland to meet with the users and SMEs to really understand their process.</p>
        <p class="article-text"> It turned out that everyone had a slightly different understanding of how the BPO process worked, so I got everyone in a room with post-its to figure out exactly what the end-to-end workflow was. The result was a big and complicated diagram that served as a touchpoint throughout the project.</p>

      <article class="charlie">
        <p class="article-text">Once we returned from Ireland, I jumped into design mode. Working from both the new flow diagram and some requirements we'd gathered, I started roughing out the layout for what we began calling the Vendor Management Product. I used a storytelling technique to refine the requirements and create a bridge between text and design to get a more detailed view of functionality.</p>
        <p class="article-text">The idea of the product was to create a single source of truth for client and vendor. This would allow them each to request a certain amount of work and commit to a certain hour of work, therefore providing a transparency and history that could be billed/negotiated on later.</p>

There were many new concepts that needed to be fit into our existing product in order to replace Stripes spreadsheets.

      </div>
      <article class="foxtrot">
        <p class="article-text">I spent another two years of my career making some playing cards. These cards started as a side project as I was learning to play bridge at work lunches. I thought it would be really nice to create some custom playing cards for our group, but I had no idea it would morph into something so much bigger and more fraught.</p>
        <p class="article-text">I'm sure you've seen these before, just some generic playing cards. I tried to think of how I could make mine unique, but what I started to realize was just how pathetically Eurocentric the 'default' set is.</p>
        <p class="article-text">Every project I do, I approach from a product angle. I spend a lot of time conceptualizing and refining that concept, researching and trying to figure out the core of the project, doesn't matter if it's a deck of cards or a payment product.</p>
        <p class="article-text">I started to sketch with better representation in mind, and it got complicated and confusing. I struggled with making them different and obviously diverse, but at the same time trying to maintain the "traditional" aesthetic, in order to serve as a straight replacement, potentially without anyone really noticing.</p>

      <article class="foxtrot">
        <p class="article-text">Adding the patterns and coloring for each card and making them consistent with one another, but still unique to each face card required so many revisions and sheer willpower to keep going. But as in my regular product design day job, I know through iteration that each version will bring me closer to the aesthetic that's in my mind.</p>

      <article class="foxtrot">
        <p class="article-text">I iterated and iterated on the face cards and kept refining the patterns. There's a lot of back and forth and trying things out, testing things together and letting go of certain parts that just don't work.</p>
        <p class="article-text">I did a fair amount of design system creation, making a custom typeface that included the suit pips and the numerals/letters. Every deck needs the same consistency in its design system to work together as a whole but still allow for easy differentiation.</p>
