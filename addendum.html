            <h4>
              To whomphst it may concern,
            </h4>
            <p class="padding-top-small">I am going to guess that you are confused by this “portfolio”. Perhaps a cheat of a guess because you clicked on a link that asks if you are confused about this portfolio, but I’m trying not to assume, here.</p>
            <p class="padding-top-small">I suspect you might be wondering where all the product design is for this so-called product designer, so I want to take a second to clarify that it’s all around, don’t worry, you’re in the right place! My design philosophy doesn’t differ whether I’m working on a form for a website or or a piece of lettering or yes, a deck of cards. I have <a href="kitchen-sink.html">plenty of experience</a> coding up CSS changes, reworking layouts, iterating on design solutions, prioritizing and advocating for user feedback, creating consistency in design systems, and refining user workflows, but ala Beatrice Warde, that’s all crystal goblet.</p>
            <p class="padding-top-small">In this portfolio teaser, I intended to show, not the end result for a design piece, but my process and range. Sure, this main study is a print product, but a deck of cards has its own physical interface, its own carefully considered design system, and its own detailed execution down to the size of the dot fill in the custom lettering or the ink traps in the pip symbols. I wanted to show that I can spend two years on a finely detailed project with loads of parts that needed to work together and support a pretty big underlying concept, but can also spend half a day in the browser web inspector cleaning up a page that’s shipping tomorrow and getting a quick PR out, but I realized neither of these samples (nor anything I can simply display), can really capture all the thoughtfulness that goes into the best product design. Nothing shown can capture the collaboration, and hard thinking that comprise 90% of the job—really, drawing is the fastest part of the job, and no portfolio can capture the one single hardest part of product design: talking to other people.</p>
            <p class="padding-top-small">Real product design, real design worth anything, is made up of discussion and careful observation and working with people to address needs and talk through or wrestle ideas, the quality of the design execution is directly derived from the quality of those interactions; not from a designer in a vacuum as some glorified make-it-pretty-pixel-perfect-please-unicorn.</p>
            <p class="padding-top-small">So, you may wonder to yourself: How the heck am I supposed to get an idea of you as a designer and whether I should hire you with this weird-ass portfolio that you are explaining can never capture what product design is about anyway?</p>
            <p class="padding-top-small"><em>Welp, I guess we <a href="mailto:sheriff@onehorse.town">just have to talk.</a></em></p>
